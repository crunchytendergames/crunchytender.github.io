					 <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align:left; color:#000000; font-size: 18px; !important">Short description</p>
					 
                     <p style="text-align:left">
					 This Privacy Policy applies to users anywhere in the world using this application. 
					 This Policy explains how the app collects information about you, your device, and how we use it. 
					 If you choose to use the application, you consent to the collection and use of information in connection with this Policy. 
					 Using the application means the user's unconditional consent to this Policy and the conditions for processing his personal information specified in it. 
					 We strongly recommend that you read the Privacy Policy and in case of disagreement, you will have to remove this application from your device or refuse to download and 
					 use it in the future.

					 <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align:left; color:#000000; font-size: 18px; !important">Collection and use of information</p>
					 
                     <p style="text-align:left">
					Technical data of the user's device, such as Android advertising ID, approximate location (country, city), language, IP address,
					unique device identifier (permanent / non-permanent). Actions in the application (for example, the number of levels completed). 
					Data such as device models, operating system version and country are also available in the Google Play Developer Console. 
					This data is available to the administrator to identify app errors on your device so that we can fix it, as well as release a new app update for safe use. 
					The game processes and uses only the data that is necessary for the functioning of the game.

                     <p style="text-align:left">
					Services that provide in-app advertising may receive certain technical information (for example, Android advertising ID, approximate location,
					IP addresses, interest data, device IDs) to serve you personalized ads. Also, services that provide analytics within the 
					application can receive certain information (for example, approximate location, number of levels completed, time in the game).
					The information that is used and stored on your device is in no way collected or stored by the developer. 
					The application uses third party services that may collect information used to identify you. We recommend that you read their privacy policies for more 
					information on how they process data.<br>
